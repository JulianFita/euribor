## About

This project focuses on the analysis of Euribor data. It includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and uses machine learning techniques to predict future Euribor values.

## Key Features

- Perform data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and trends.
- Build machine learning models for Euribor value prediction.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.11.4)
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- R (version 4.2.2)
- RStudio or any R IDE

### Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python packages using the following command:


Install the required R packages using the following command:

```R
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "rvest", "highcharter", "lubridate", "zoo"))
```

## Usage

Explain how to use the project and provide examples.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In the `EDA` directory, you'll find notebooks and scripts related to Exploratory Data Analysis. This section provides insights into the data, visualizes trends, and prepares the data for prediction.

### Libraries Used for EDA

- `tidyverse`
- `rvest`
- `highcharter`
- `lubridate`
- `zoo`

## Value Prediction

The `Prediction` directory contains notebooks and scripts for predicting future Euribor values. It involves the use of machine learning models to forecast Euribor trends.

### Libraries Used for Value Prediction

- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`
- `bokeh`
- `scipy`
